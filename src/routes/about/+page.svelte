<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I graduated from UC Davis with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I
  currently work as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn under Product Application and Infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy playing music in a band setting. I have a passion for building open-source projects that
  empower developers in their career journeys.
</p>

<p>
  I recharge from the busyness by shooting photos, playing foosball with friends and catching up for
  a good meal. When I go outdoors, I prefer hiking trails and recreational parks. Occasionally, I
  travel outside to experience new cultures. Here are the places I visited:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>US states: Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Wyoming, Ohio, Chicago</li>
  <li>Countries: Taiwan, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Italy</li>
</ul>

<p>I currently attend these churches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://glorious-light.net/">Glorious Light Christian Church</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://echo.church">Echo Church</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  My parents are an important part of my life. They shaped me into who I am today, and I am proud to
  be their son.
</p>

<p>
  I am blessed with a lovely wife who enjoys planting flowers, making crafts and eating pastries. I
  am also the father of two kids, and they make the old saying become a reality:
