## Getting Started

There are a couple steps to getting started.

### Install packages

Install the package dependencies:

    yarn install

### Run tests

Run the test suite to make sure everything works as expected:

    yarn test

### Create build

Recompile the `dist` assets for development:

    yarn build:dev

Or recompile the `dist` assets for production:

    yarn build:prod

Review the final output by opening up `index.html`.
